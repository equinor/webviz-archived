Webviz Default Theme
====================

- Uses icons from [free fontawesome solid][fa]
- Uses [ACSS][] (Yahoos flavour of atomic css)
- Uses [Open Color][] color palette. These colors can be used with any ACSS class that specifies a color, for example:
    - `<p class="C(yellow-1) Bgc(gray-7)">Some yellow text on a dark grey background</p>`
- The [burn icon][] used in the placeholder logo is from Font Awesome and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. See [their license][fa license] for further details.
